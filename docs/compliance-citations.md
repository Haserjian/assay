## EU AI Act

### Article 12: Record-keeping (logging)

High-risk AI systems shall technically allow for the automatic recording
of events (logs) over the lifetime of the system.

### Article 19: Automatically generated logs

Providers of high-risk AI systems shall keep the logs automatically
generated by their high-risk AI systems, to the extent such logs are
under their control. The logs shall be kept for an appropriate period
of time that is at least **6 months**, unless provided otherwise in
applicable Union or national law.

### Timeline

- **2 Aug 2025**: Prohibited AI practices apply
- **2 Aug 2026**: High-risk obligations apply (Annex III systems)
- **2 Aug 2027**: High-risk obligations apply (regulated products)

### Article 99: Penalties

Maximum penalties for the most severe categories: up to 35 million EUR
or 7% of total worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher. Lower
tiers exist for other categories of infringement.

### Note on potential delays

There has been public discussion about delaying some high-risk obligations
as part of broader EU digital simplification efforts. As of February 2026,
the timeline above reflects the enacted regulation. Monitor the AI Act
Service Desk for updates.

## SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria

### CC7.2: Monitoring and detection

The entity monitors system components and the operation of those
components for anomalies that are indicative of malicious acts, natural
disasters, and errors affecting the entity's ability to meet its
objectives; anomalies are analyzed to determine whether they represent
security events.

## ISO 42001

ISO/IEC 42001:2023 specifies requirements for establishing, implementing,
maintaining, and continually improving an AI management system. Relevant
sections include documentation requirements and evidence of governance
processes.

Assay evidence packs may support documentation requirements but do not
constitute full ISO 42001 compliance on their own.

## NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)

The NIST AI RMF provides guidance on governance, accountability, and
documentation practices for AI systems. Assay aligns with the GOVERN
and MAP functions through evidence-based accountability.

## How Assay maps to these frameworks

| Requirement | Framework | What Assay provides |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Automatic logging | EU AI Act Art. 12 | Receipt emission on every LLM call |
| Log retention | EU AI Act Art. 19 | Evidence packs are portable files (retain as long as needed) |
| Tamper resistance | EU AI Act Art. 12 | Ed25519 signatures + SHA-256 hash chains |
| Monitoring evidence | SOC 2 CC7.2 | Receipts record model, tokens, latency, errors per call |
| Governance documentation | ISO 42001 | Evidence packs + verification reports + lockfile contracts |
| Accountability | NIST AI RMF | Independently verifiable evidence trail |

**Assay is one building block for these requirements.** It does not
constitute full compliance with any framework on its own. Consult your
compliance team or legal counsel for framework-specific requirements.
